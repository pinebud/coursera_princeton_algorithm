I. Questions:
- In Quick Union demo, why union(5,4) do nothing?
- (Henrik) The algorithm will check the conectivity between 5 and 4 and if they were connected then the loop will skip.

II. To do further investigation:
- Need to know how do the time efforts of QF, QU, WQU, PCQU, WPCQU be computed.

III. Update unit test framework.
1.  Use an autowired list to hold all IUF type beans then iterate the list for testing.
    Autowired(required = false)
    private List<IUF> unionFindMethods;
2.  Move the test bean definition file from source folder i.e. src/main/java/week1-appContext.xml to test resource folder i.e. src/test/resources/coursera/princeton/algorithm/part1/week1/UFBasicTest-context.xml. 
3.  Use @ContextConfiguration to replace the way of directly calling ApplicationContext, since only beans inside context is what we cared about, not the context itself.
